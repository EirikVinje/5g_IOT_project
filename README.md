IoT Device Grouping in 5G Networks Using ML
methods for Enhanced Resource Management

### Info

The integration of IoT devices within 5G networks introduces significant
challenges in managing the diverse and massive number of connected
devices.

Efficiently grouping these devices based on their communication patterns,
latency requirements, and data traffic profiles is crucial for optimizing
resource allocation and network performance.

This project proposes the use of ML to categorize IoT devices in a 5G network
into distinct clusters based on key parameters such as data transmission
frequency, latency sensitivity, and power consumption.

By clustering devices with similar characteristics, the network can allocate
resources more efficiently, prioritize critical communication, and reduce
congestion.

The project will involve developing a clustering algorithm tailored to the 5G-
IoT environment, evaluating its performance through simulations, and
exploring how this approach can improve overall network efficiency, reduce
latency, and enhance the quality of service for various IoT applications.
